Nginx is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer that is widely used for serving static content, reverse proxying to application servers, and providing load balancing. It is often used in conjunction with Node.js applications to improve performance, scalability, and security.

Uses of Nginx in Node.js Applications
Reverse Proxy:

Nginx can act as a reverse proxy server, forwarding client requests to one or more Node.js application servers. This setup helps in distributing the load and improving the application's performance and reliability.
Load Balancing:

Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across multiple Node.js servers to balance the load and ensure high availability. This is essential for handling high traffic and preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
Serving Static Files:

Nginx is highly efficient at serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), offloading this task from the Node.js server. This allows the Node.js application to focus on handling dynamic content and business logic.
SSL Termination:

Nginx can handle SSL termination, managing secure connections (HTTPS) and decrypting incoming traffic before passing it to the Node.js server. This simplifies SSL management and reduces the overhead on the Node.js server.
Security:

Nginx can be configured to provide various security features, such as rate limiting, IP whitelisting/blacklisting, and protection against DDoS attacks. This helps to secure the Node.js application from common web threats.



// first create ubuntu image using docker

docker run -it -p 8080:80 ubuntu



apt-get update

apt-get install nginx

nginx // it will start nginix localhost:8080


go to cd /etc/nginx

vim nginx.conf  //change the default data to below data

also u can add domain names......

after that restart nginx

nginx -s reload
