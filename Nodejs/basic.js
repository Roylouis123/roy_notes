//Uses of Node.js 

// Web Servers: Building RESTful APIs and web applications.
// Real-Time Applications: Chat applications, live updates, and collaboration tools.
// Command Line Tools: Scripts to automate tasks.
// Microservices: Creating small, independent services that communicate over a network.
// Static File Serving: Serving static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
// Data Streaming: Handling real-time data streams (e.g., audio/video streaming).
// IoT: Managing Internet of Things devices.


// Introduction
// Node.js uses JavaScript as its scripting language, leveraging the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.
//  This allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming.

// V8 JavaScript Engine
// V8 Engine: Developed by Google for the Chrome browser, it compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, making it extremely fast.
// Integration with Node.js: Node.js uses the V8 engine to run JavaScript code on the server. It provides a runtime environment that includes
//  a set of built-in libraries and APIs for file system access, networking, and other server-side functionalities.




// Node.js Modules
// Node.js includes several core modules implemented in JavaScript and C++:

// http: For creating HTTP servers and clients.
// fs: For interacting with the file system.
// path: For working with file and directory paths.
// os: For providing information about the operating system.
