How to optimize website assets loading?
// To optimize website load time we need to optimize its asset loading and for that:

// CDN hosting - A CDN or content delivery network is geographically distributed servers to help reduce latency.
// File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer
// File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls
// Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files
// Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings.
// Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis.
